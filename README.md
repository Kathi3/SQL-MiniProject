# SQL-MiniProject

## Project Overview
In this project, we were provided with a detailed description of what we were expexted to do.

## Project Description
The US elections are coming up and a candidate is seeking help to become the US president. The winner of the election will be the candidate winning the most grand electors. 
Grand electors are attributed at the state level: in each of the 51 states, there is a given number of grand electors to win (roughly, but not exactly, proportional to the size of the state) and the presidential candidate receiving the most local votes wins ALL the Grand Electors in that state.
Because the number of grand electors is not exactly proportional to the population, some states can be prioritized to increase the return on investment of the campaign. We assume here there are only 2 candidates, and no history (no trend of certain states to vote for a particular candidate or party). Hence, each vote is equally "expensive" to get, but some states grant more grand elector per capita. 


## Deliverables used in Data mining include:
We were asked to identify the states that should be prioritized to win the election, with a smart but simple algorithm.

## The data provided:
We were provided with 2 dataset. One giving information on GrandElectors per state and the other Population by State.
1) Grand Electors by State https://drive.google.com/a/moringaschool.com/file/d/1AuPlNXKjmEdRTLGqKbP-OP1XZ5UQPIPw/view?usp=sharing 
2) Population By State https://drive.google.com/a/moringaschool.com/file/d/1VKt_hF2pRqPxcNb1DKotkVXWNd2HX_KL/view?usp=sharing


## The steps that were be followed:
Importing Libraries, Data Loading, Data Understanding, Data Cleanup, Data Exploration and Modelling, Evaluation and Recommedation
